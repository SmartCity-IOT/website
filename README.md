# IoT Security Lab — Static Website

A simple, professional multi-page site (no frameworks, fully offline) suitable for submission.

## Structure
- `index.html` — landing
- `datasets.html` — dataset releases (edit the table rows)
- `dashboard.html` — demo dashboard (replace with real API fetches)
- `projects.html`, `team.html`, `docs.html`, `contact.html`
- `assets/css/style.css` — theming
- `assets/js/app.js` — tiny chart demo

## How to edit
Open files in any editor (VS Code). Replace placeholder text, add rows to the dataset table, and update team members.

## How to deploy
Upload the folder to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or your uni web space). It also runs by double-clicking `index.html`.

## To make it "exactly like another site"
Share screenshots or the color/section structure you want me to match. I can then update the styles and layout precisely.
